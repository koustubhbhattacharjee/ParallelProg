'''data races means fighting for the same data by different threads and it gets STUCK.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
race condition occur due to timing/ordering of the program and leads to bad behavior.
They are (pun intended), mutually exclusive

Different orders of execution create different outcomes. That is called a race condition.

Heisenbug, it dissapears when you study it.

ALSO, the way OS Schedules threads can be üö©{non-deterministic}'''

#from concurrent.futures import thread

    ''' pencil is meant to hold the lock below

        |
       \_/

    so these threads are data safe and dont have data racing. But they have RACE condition.

    How to avoid such a race condition?
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    BARRIERS(huddling)

    For functions which are susceptible to a race condition, we can have a barrier in the middle which is akin to huddling.
    Remember we need to make a barrier between üö®{ONLY those GROUPS} of threads which may have a race condition.
